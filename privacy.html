  <h1>Privacy Policy for [App Name]</h1>
  <p>Effective date: [Date]</p>

  <p>
    [App Name] (“we”, “us”, or “our”) uses the Garmin Health API to access your

    <li>Physiological metrics (e.g., heart rate, HRV, sleep, training load)</li>
    <li>Basic profile information (e.g., Garmin user ID, display name)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We do not collect any other personal data beyond what you authorize through Garmin.</p>

  <h2>2. How We Use Your Data</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Provide the core functionality of [App Name], such as training analysis and recommendations</li>
    <li>Maintain and improve the performance and reliability of the service</li>

  <p>
    We do not disclose your Garmin activity or physiological data to any third parties, except:
  </p>

    <li>Service providers that host or operate our infrastructure (e.g., cloud hosting),
        who are bound by confidentiality and data-protection obligations; and</li>
    <li>Where required by law, such as to comply with a valid legal request.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>
  <p>
    Data is transmitted using encrypted connections (HTTPS/TLS) and stored using
    reasonable technical and organizational measures designed to protect it from
    unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
  <p>
    We retain your data only for as long as your account is active or as needed
    to provide [App Name]. If you close your account or request deletion, we will
    delete or anonymize your stored Garmin data within a reasonable period,
    typically within 30 days, except where retention is required by law.
